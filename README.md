# Network traffic monitoring and analysis (TMA) project
This is the shared repository for the Network traffic monitoring and analysis (TMA) project
We used the dataset CSE-CIC-IDS2018
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html
We generated consolidate files with different attacks in order to build a model using Weka.
We identified the best precision with Random Forest.
